# Capacited-Vehical-Routing-Problem

Vehicle Routing Problem aims to find an optimal schedule for a fleet of vehicles to deliver 
goods to customers. In order to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem, we propose two variants
alongside the sweep heuristic which comes under the family of cluster-first, route-second 
approaches and Clarke and Wright savings heuristic. For cluster-first, route-second 
algorithms the customers are divided into subsets in the first stage so that each set has the 
maximum number of customers that can be served within a tour. In the following step, all 
assigned clusters' optimal tours are calculated. The two proposed variants differ in the 
clustering phase. For routing phase MTZ formulation is used for all the three methods. We 
compare the performance of the savings and sweep heuristics and two distance based 
variants of sweep that are considered in this paper.


#OBJECTIVE: 
To study and implement Sweep Heuristic to solve the CVRP.
To minimize the number of vehicles used and the distance travelled by it in each subset
